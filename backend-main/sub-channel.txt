1. Every user can subs to each channel
2. Every channel can have multiple user 
3. For to count the each subs for each channel the statergy will be - 1. we will create the document which will bind the user and the channel he have subscribe to and the channel will be having this info.
                                                                      2. Then we want to display the subscr count will be simply use the query in the channel and not in the user because the channel will be 1-5 million subscriber which can be a headache so simply run the query on the channel which will was that document and based on that document we will get the user count.
